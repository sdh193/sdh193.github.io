<p>Whenever you open the Monopoly Player, you will see a header that says "Monopoly" on the top of the screen and a frame containing some input boxes, headers, and buttons. This frame is the frame that you will play the monopoly game in. </p>
<p>To start a game, simply type the names, colors, and tokens of each player.

You cannot have more than four players in the same game. If you want to change the initial number of money for each player, click "settings". When you are done setting the number of players, filling in the inputs, choosing the token for each player, and adjusting the inital money for each player if desired, then you should click the "Start Game" button to start the new game. Once you have done this, a board will appear, and you can start playing.</p>
