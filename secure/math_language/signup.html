There is some good advice and rules about making a good username and password. Here it is:
<ul>
<div align=center>
<li>Make sure your username is less than 10 characters. Usernames are best when they are easy to remember.</li>
<li>Your password should be more than 8 characters and less than 15 characters.</li>
<li>Your password is stored in a highly secured place where no hacker can hijack it unless they get access to your PC.</li>
